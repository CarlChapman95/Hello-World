# Hello-World
Description
My name is Carl Chapman
I am learning to code as I am looking to improve my financial status in a career that I believe I would enjoy and do well in. 
This is a way to channel my energies positively instead of sitting around doing nothing after work. 
It's also to provide a better life for my son.
